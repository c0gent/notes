### Move BTC/ETH/LTC/BCH to a USD account (relatively) quickly without paying extra fees

*2018-July-03*

It's possible to transfer BTC/BCH to USD through a [BitPay
Card](https://bitpay.com/card) but if you don't have one already, you will
have to wait 7-10 days for the card to arrive in the mail and then another
3-10 days for an ACH transfer to go through. You will also pay a $5 fee to
BitPay and probably a $15-30 fee to your bank.

A better method to transfer BTC/ETH/LTC/BCH into USD relatively quickly and
without additional fees is to create a [Coinbase
Pro](https://pro.coinbase.com) (formerly GDAX) account. You will need to
upload photos of your drivers license / photo id and will be required to take
a portrait. The overall withdrawal process will still take at least 3(?) days.

  1. Create a Coinbase Pro account. Coinbase Pro is GDAX rebranded and the
     interface is similar to what it was just before the name change. You'll
     have to wait a few minutes after creating the account for them to approve
     it.

  2. Click `Deposit` on the left then choose your currency.

  3. A wallet address will appear.
     * You can also transfer from a regular Coinbase account by clicking on the
      `COINBASE *** WALLET` tab on the same 'Deposit Funds' pop-up window that
      displays the wallet address.

  4. Send coin from your wallet (containing funds) to the Coinbase Pro wallet
     address (above).

  5. Wait for the transaction to go through (minutes to hours).

  6. Back on the [Coinbase Pro Trading Page](https://pro.coinbase.com/trade/),
     click the **SELL** button on the left.

  7. To avoid any 'taker' fees, place a **LIMIT (SELL)** order for *slightly*
     higher than the current market. A *MARKET* order will incur a 0.03%
     (taker) fee.
     * Obviously the usual caveats of market orders apply (your trade may not
       go through, etc.).
     * It's unclear how long this 0% 'maker' rate will last (see the [Coinbase
       Support Fees
       Page](https://support.pro.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2945310-fees?b_id=17474)
       for up to date information).
     * If your LIMIT-SELL order is too high, your order might take a long time
       (or forever) to go through. If your LIMIT-SELL order is too low, you
       will pay 0.03% taker fees on any amount traded below your order price.
       See the [Order Types
       Page](https://support.pro.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2945313-overview-of-order-types-and-settings-stop-limit-market-?b_id=17474)
       for more information.
     * **If you don't want risk your order not going through, or if you are in
       a hurry, choose MARKET and pay the fee.**

 8. Link a bank account. Withdraw, etc...
