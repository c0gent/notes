## What I've Been Working On - 2018-July-03 Meetup Notes

* Integration of hbbft into Parity:
	* Research / Education
		* Parity Code Diving:
			* Largely preliminary exploration but now focused on the details of
			  the transaction queue and the peer-to-peer network stack.
		* Reading:
			* [The Honey Badger of BFT Protocols](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/199.pdf)
			* [Ethereum White Paper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper)
			* [Ethereum Wire Protocol](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Wire-Protocol)


	* Experimenting
		* Creating a [peer-to-peer
		  client](https://github.com/c0gent/hydrabadger) for hbbft which has
		  an extremely simple networking stack, transaction queue, and
		  blockchain (bitcoin-style). Nothing is implemented yet -- completely
		  pre-alpha-alpha stage.

* Open questions: How much time should I devote to [poa-bridge PR
  #107](https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-bridge/pull/110) this week?
